              <p class="description">
              Cyberbullying is sending mean text messages, spreading rumours on social media, 
              ganging up on or deliberately excluding someone in an online game, 
              or sharing an embarrassing photo with other people’. How it might feel to be cyberbullied – 
              for example, ‘Being cyberbullied can make you feel very upset and lonely. 
              It can make you not want to join in activities where the person doing the bullying might be’. 
              The consequences of cyberbullying – for example, ‘People who get cyberbullied can stop doing 
              well at school and feel depressed, anxious or even suicidal’.
              </p>
              <h4 class="content-heading">Technology rules to help your child avoid cyberbullying</h4>
              <p class="description">
                Agreeing on clear rules about when your child can use their mobile phone, 
                computer or tablet can help them avoid cyberbullying. 
                For example, cyberbullying often happens at night through text messages and shared images. 
                It can help to have a family rule that everyone switches off devices at night and leaves them in a family area.

                <li>
                  <i class="fas fa-check"></i> Accept only people he knows as online friends and followers.
                   If your child adds someone he doesn’t really know as a ‘buddy’, ‘friend’ or ‘follower’, 
                   it gives that person access to information about your child that could be used for bullying.

                <li>
                  <i class="fas fa-check"></i> Don’t give out passwords.  Some teenagers 
                  give their passwords to friends as a sign of trust, but a password 
                  gives other people the power to pose as your child online.

                <li>
                  <i class="fas fa-check"></i> Think before you post. If your child posts 
                  personal comments, photos or videos she might get unwanted attention or 
                  negative comments. People can screenshot or download the comments and photos 
                  and share and post them anywhere. They can also be available online for a long time.

                <li>
                  <i class="fas fa-check"></i> Tell you, a teacher or another trusted adult
